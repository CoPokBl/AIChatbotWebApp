# AI ChatBot Web App
This app is just a web version of [this project](https://github.com/CoPokBl/OpenAIChatBot). 
Just run it and navigate to the page and you can chat with the bot.  

It doesn't look very good yet, but it works.

**Please note that this requires an OpenAI API key. You can get one [here](https://beta.openai.com/).**
