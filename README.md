# AI ChatBot Web App
This app is just a web version of [this project](https://github.com/CoPokBl/OpenAIChatBot). 
Just run it and navigate to the page and you can chat with the bot.  

It doesn't look very good yet, but it works.

It is hosted using CloudFlare pages at 
[chatbot.serble.net](https://chatbot.serble.net/) and 
[chatbot.zaneharrison.com](https://chatbot.zaneharrison.com/)

**Please note that this requires an OpenAI API key. You can get one [here](https://beta.openai.com/).**
